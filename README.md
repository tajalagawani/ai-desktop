# AI Desktop

A lightweight, web-based AI desktop environment with integrated development tools, deployment automation, and Claude AI integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start (VPS Installation)

Install AI Desktop on your VPS with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tajalagawani/ai-desktop/lightweight-client/install-vps-complete.sh | bash
```

Or download and run manually:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tajalagawani/ai-desktop/lightweight-client/install-vps-complete.sh
chmod +x install-vps-complete.sh
./install-vps-complete.sh
```

The installation script will:
- ✅ Install all dependencies (Node.js, PM2, Nginx, code-server)
- ✅ Set up the application with proper VPS paths
- ✅ Configure Nginx reverse proxy
- ✅ Start services with PM2
- ✅ Enable auto-start on reboot

After installation, access AI Desktop at: `http://YOUR_VPS_IP`

- **Development Mode**: Apps run with `npm run dev` for quick deployment
- **PM2 Process Manager**: Reliable process management with auto-restart
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Single entry point for all services

### Storage Structure
```
/root/ai-desktop/              # Application code
/var/www/repositories/         # User git repositories
/var/www/github/               # GitHub clones
/var/www/ai-desktop/
├── data/                      # JSON storage
│   ├── repositories.json
│   ├── deployments.json
│   └── mcp-servers.json
└── logs/                      # Deployment logs
```

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### PM2 Process Management
```bash
pm2 status                      # View all processes
pm2 logs                        # View all logs
pm2 logs ai-desktop-backend     # Backend logs only
pm2 logs ai-desktop-frontend    # Frontend logs only
pm2 restart all                 # Restart all services
pm2 restart ai-desktop-backend  # Restart backend only
```

### Data Management
```bash
# View repositories
cat /var/www/ai-desktop/data/repositories.json

# Clear all repositories
rm -rf /var/www/repositories/*
echo '{"repositories":[]}' > /var/www/ai-desktop/data/repositories.json

# View deployments
cat /var/www/ai-desktop/data/deployments.json
pm2 list | grep deployment  # See running deployments
```

### Nginx Management
```bash
nginx -t                        # Test configuration
systemctl restart nginx         # Restart nginx
systemctl status nginx          # Check status
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # View error logs
```

## 🔐 Security

### Firewall Configuration
The installation script automatically configures UFW to allow:
- Port 22 (SSH)
- Port 80 (HTTP)

### API Keys
- Store API keys in `.env` files (never commit to git)
- Use Security Center in the UI for secure MCP server credentials
- Encryption key auto-generated during installation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting
```bash
pm2 logs ai-desktop-backend
# Check for port conflicts or missing dependencies
```

### Frontend Build Errors
```bash
cd /root/ai-desktop
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart ai-desktop-frontend
```

### Nginx 502 Error
```bash
# Check if backend is running
pm2 status
# Restart services
pm2 restart all
systemctl restart nginx
```

### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check deployment logs
ls -la /var/www/ai-desktop/logs/
cat /var/www/ai-desktop/logs/DEPLOYMENT_ID.log

# Check PM2 processes
pm2 list | grep deployment
pm2 logs deployment-DEPLOYMENT_ID
```
