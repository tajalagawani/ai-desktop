# API Routes Directory

This directory is reserved for Next.js API routes.

When you're ready to add backend functionality, create files here:
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Authentication
- `app/api/workflows/route.ts` - Workflow management
- `app/api/files/route.ts` - File operations

Each file should export handler functions:
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Handle GET requests
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Handle POST requests
}
```
