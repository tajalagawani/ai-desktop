## 📋 What You Asked

**Request:** {user_request}

## ❌ What I Attempted

**Action:** {attempted_action}
**Target:** `{target_file}`

## 🚫 Why This Is Forbidden

I can only modify files within:
- ✅ `flow-architect/`
- ✅ `~/.claude/skills/flow-architect/`

I cannot access:
- ❌ `app/` - Main application code
- ❌ `components/` - React components
- ❌ `lib/` - Core libraries
- ❌ `package.json` - Dependencies
- ❌ Any files outside my sandbox

## ✅ What I Can Do Instead

{flow_based_alternative}

**How this works:**
1. I create an isolated ACT flow file
2. The flow runs in its own Docker container
3. It achieves your goal without modifying your app
4. Results are returned to you

## 🤔 Would You Like Me To Proceed?

I can create this flow-based solution right now. It will:
- Run independently of your main application
- Not modify any of your code
- Achieve the same result safely

**Shall I create the flow?**
